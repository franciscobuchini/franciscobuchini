I am a passionate frontend designer and programmer with a diverse background. I began my journey in the world of graphic design, later exploring the fascinating field of UX/UI. For two years, I immersed myself in web programming, fusing my solid foundation in design with technical skills to create memorable and functional digital experiences.
